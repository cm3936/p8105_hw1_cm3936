and year.

The the data set has 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length is 200.92 millimeters.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
